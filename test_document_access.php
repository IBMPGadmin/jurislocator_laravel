echo "\n=== Key Changes Made ===\n";
echo "1. ViewLegalTableController: Updated to handle null client_id\n";
echo "2. view-legal-table-data.blade.php: Updated meta tags to handle null client\n";
echo "3. user-legal-tables.blade.php: Updated redirectToDocument function\n";
echo "4. user-legal-tables.blade.php: Updated JavaScript to not require client for navigation\n";
echo "5. Content editor and droppable area: Always available regardless of client selection\n\n";

echo "=== User Experience Flow ===\n";
echo "1. User visits /client-management → Can see legal tables immediately\n";
echo "2. User clicks 'View Document' → Opens document without client requirement\n";
echo "3. User can drag/drop content and edit text → No restrictions\n";
echo "4. User saves content → Can choose 'User Only' (default) or 'Client Specific'\n";
echo "5. If 'Client Specific' selected without client → Will be saved as 'User Only'\n\n";

echo "=== Implementation Complete ===\n";
echo "✅ Document viewing no longer requires client selection\n";
echo "✅ Content editor and droppable areas are always accessible\n";
echo "✅ Saving prompts for context (User vs Client) rather than blocking access\n";
