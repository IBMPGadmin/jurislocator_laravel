# Section Matching Fix Implementation

## Overview

We have implemented a multi-layered approach to fix the issue where clicking on "Section 17" incorrectly shows both Section 17 and Section 170 content.

## Solution Layers

### 1. SERVER-SIDE FILTERING
- Enhanced SQL queries in `ViewLegalTableController.php` with strict matching for numeric section IDs
- Used BINARY comparison for exact string matching
- Added special handling for different section ID formats (numeric, subsections, complex IDs)

### 2. CLIENT-SIDE FETCH API INTERCEPTION
- Created `exact-section-matcher.js` to intercept fetch API calls
- Added custom headers for exact matching requirements
- Applied strict filtering to numeric section IDs

### 3. DOM-LEVEL FILTERING
- Created `last-resort-filter.js` as a fail-safe mechanism
- Uses MutationObserver to detect and filter popups when they appear in the DOM
- Applies exact word boundary matching for section numbers

### 4. DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS
- Added `section-debug-tool.js` for visual debugging of the section matching process
- Created `section_matching_diagnostic.php` script to verify SQL queries

## Implementation Details

This comprehensive approach ensures that clicking on "Section 17" will only show Section 17 content, not Section 170 or any other similar sections.

The solution is designed to be robust and maintainable, with multiple layers of protection to catch any issues that might slip through individual layers.

## How to Test

1. Click on a reference to "Section 17" in the document
2. Verify that ONLY Section 17 appears in the popup, not Section 170
3. Test with other numeric sections (e.g., Section 46) to ensure proper filtering
4. Check the browser console for detailed debug information
