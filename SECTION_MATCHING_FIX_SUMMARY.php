echo "===== SECTION MATCHING FIX IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY =====\n\n";

echo "We have implemented a multi-layered approach to fix the issue where clicking on 'Section 17' 
incorrectly shows both Section 17 and Section 170 content.\n\n";

echo "SOLUTION LAYERS:\n\n";

echo "1. SERVER-SIDE FILTERING:\n";
echo "   - Enhanced SQL queries in ViewLegalTableController.php with strict matching for numeric section IDs\n";
echo "   - Used BINARY comparison for exact string matching\n";
echo "   - Added special handling for different section ID formats (numeric, subsections, complex IDs)\n\n";

echo "2. CLIENT-SIDE FETCH API INTERCEPTION:\n";
echo "   - Created exact-section-matcher.js to intercept fetch API calls\n";
echo "   - Added custom headers for exact matching requirements\n";
echo "   - Applied strict filtering to numeric section IDs\n\n";

echo "3. DOM-LEVEL FILTERING:\n";
echo "   - Created last-resort-filter.js as a fail-safe mechanism\n";
echo "   - Uses MutationObserver to detect and filter popups when they appear in the DOM\n";
echo "   - Applies exact word boundary matching for section numbers\n\n";

echo "4. DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS:\n";
echo "   - Added section-debug-tool.js for visual debugging of the section matching process\n";
echo "   - Created section_matching_diagnostic.php script to verify SQL queries\n\n";

echo "This comprehensive approach ensures that clicking on 'Section 17' will only show 
Section 17 content, not Section 170 or any other similar sections.\n\n";

echo "The solution is designed to be robust and maintainable, with multiple layers of protection
to catch any issues that might slip through individual layers.\n\n";

echo "===== HOW TO TEST =====\n\n";

echo "1. Click on a reference to 'Section 17' in the document\n";
echo "2. Verify that ONLY Section 17 appears in the popup, not Section 170\n";
echo "3. Test with other numeric sections (e.g., Section 46) to ensure proper filtering\n";
echo "4. Check the browser console for detailed debug information\n\n";

echo "===== IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE =====\n";
